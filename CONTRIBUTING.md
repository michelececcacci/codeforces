The project doesn't have formal contributing guidelines yet, but if you want
to add something or improve existing code, please open a pull request!
The only requirement is to have unit tests for existing new features, and using
the `gofmt` tool for code formatting before pushing (just run `gofmt -w .` in the
root folder).
